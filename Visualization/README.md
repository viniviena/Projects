# Data Visuals

This folder contain files with charts I built using matplotlib and Plotly libraries! Find below a list with the files description:

1) ``Gender degrees.png`` shows the time evolution of the proportion of male and female from college level courses in USA. 
You will see interesting patterns in this chart! Enjoy it.

2) ``exit_reactor.gif`` is an animation I built with plotly to show the time evolution of the concentration of a component at the exit of three chemical reactors. The data comes from a simulation of the reactors! I can repeat to any time-dependent data. It is very compelling and help to tell histories.

3) ``profile_reactor.gif`` is a gif I recorded of an animation built with plotly showing the time evolution of the concentration of a component along the axial dimension of a chemical reactor. The data comes from a simulation of the reactor! I can repeat to any time-dependent data. It is very compelling and help to tell histories.
