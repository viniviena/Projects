# Data Science Projects

Hi! I'm glad you are here. This repository contains some of my data science projects.

* ``Data Mining`` holds my projects related to SQL, Web Scraping and more.
* ``Visualization`` holds my projects in data visualization.
* ``Machine Learning`` folder holds projects related to predictive modeling with Machine Learning. Inside this folder there are 3 other folders: ``Sentiment analysis``, ``Spam Filter`` and ``Smelling with machines``. The first have a full implementation of a web app to classify movie reviews sentiment, the second a Spam Filter with Naive-Bayes, the third has code concerning the development of a machine learning model that can predict odor properties of molecules from their chemical structure.


I hope you can find something useful for yourself here.
